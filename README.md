⚠️ **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. 

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

Unlike Python-based brute force tools, **WalletGen** is written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, delivering up to **10x faster** performance. Whether you’re exploring lost wallets, verifying private key space, or recovering your own wallet, WalletGen gives you the power to do it efficiently and securely.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** lets you search using brute force.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Press key 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets.
*   Press key 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat.
*   Press key 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet — What’s Next?

When the program finds a wallet:
*   The search stops.
*   The details are displayed.
*   The data is saved.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into a crypto wallet.
2.  You’ll be able to transfer the funds.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen allows you to recover your Bitcoin wallet.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If your seed phrase is missing words, use * as a placeholder.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full seed.

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol.
*   Searching for missing words may take time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/core/details.webp)

I’ve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0).

### New Find 4/9/2025

After a week of non-stop wallet searching, I finally found a [wallet](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0) with 0.25 bitcoin ($19k). This is my 4th and biggest find of all time.
